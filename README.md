Project Title:<br>
"Mini Compiler for Custom Programming Language Using Manual Lexer and Parse(with Simulated Garbage Collector)".<br>

Project Abstract :<br>
This project presents a web-based Mini Compiler and Garbage Collector (GC) Simulator developed using the Flask framework in Python. The application serves as an educational tool designed to help users understand core concepts of compiler design and memory management through an interactive interface.<br>
With memory management simulation in a single tool, this project offers a practical and engaging approach to learning fundamental programming language implementation concepts.<br>
This process helps users comprehend how compilers and runtime environments track object lifetimes and reclaim memory automatically, preventing memory leaks.
